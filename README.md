</div>

### Description

This is a very essential application for system administrators and developers.This application will be able to ping on user defined interval and verify active nodes and then able to send broadcast message to all nodes in a LAN.It also able to connect and scan the ports and detect which port is open and identify what service is using that port and brief description of that port.A colorful logical map will be displayed for all nodes stating whether they are active or not active.

It will have the ability to "save" the current map settings, and load settings when the application restarts. Meaning that, a list of IP addresses from the previous execution of the application will be saved.

As a extra,i have attached a file called Port Number Reference.txt.Learn and equip yourself with port knowledge, how they are assigned,what port number belong to which service,how they are categorised etc - Very Useful.

What can be learn from this system:

*1.Textfile manipulation in Append,Input,Output Mode and how to Kill a file.

*2.Detect whether a file is exist else create a instance.

*3.Using shell Ping command and what are the command format and usage and how to store the Ping result to a file.

*4.How to verify that a node is Active or Not Active.

*5.A graphical display of the Ping result.

*6.Sending broadcast message to all the active nodes in the LAN.

*7.Text manipulation co-joined with List box interaction.

*8.Connecting and detecting ports which are opened and what service using that particular port using Winsock programming.

*9.A simple and professional looking progress bar only using 4 lines of code.

*10.Learn more about ports and how they are assigned,what port number belong to which service,how they are categorised etc.

The program is heavily commented as I want to share all the coding concepts,API's used, their functionality and why they are used.Every single module,code is commented so that the users can understand what is happening.

If you like what I have done,then vote for me and recommend it to your friends.Thank you.
